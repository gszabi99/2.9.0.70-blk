/*
Creates and returns a new debounced version of the passed function which will postpone its execution until
after wait milliseconds have elapsed since the last time it was invoked.
when delay_s_max is not a null, real delay will become random value between delay_s and delay_s_max

Useful for implementing behavior that should only happen after the input has stopped arriving.
For example: rendering a preview of a Markdown comment, recalculating a layout after the window has stopped being resized, and so on.

  Creates and returns a new, throttled version of the passed function, that, when invoked repeatedly, will only actually call the original function at most once per every wait milliseconds.
  Useful for rate-limiting events that occur faster than you can keep up with.

  By default, throttle will execute the function as soon as you call it for the first time, and, if you call it again any number of times during the wait period, as soon as that period is over.
